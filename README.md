<h1>Adobe Business Catalyst Reset Project</h1>
=====================================

<p>The purpose of this is to reset all the pre-defined styles, fix incorrectly applied classes and methods and make minor changes to it easier to apply consistent custom styles for your own site which won't conflict with 3rd party style sheets and javascript.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Just hot link the latest reset style sheet inside your html file as the first CSS reference.</p>
