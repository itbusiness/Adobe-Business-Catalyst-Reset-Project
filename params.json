Please not this is still being tested to ensure correct compression.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>A little background</h2>\r\n<p>Whenever you create a new Adobe Business Catalyst website you'll notice the following line of code gets added to any HTML file inside BC.\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;link href=\"/StyleSheets/ModuleStyleSheets.css\" type=\"text/css\" rel=\"StyleSheet\" /&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>This style sheet is the default style sheet served by Business Catalyst in order to pre-style a basic BC website.</p>\r\n<p>A major issue with this is the styles often conflict with your own custom stylesheet and many \"default\" styles do not reflect what you may want to appear in your website.</p>\r\n<p>There is also very little consistency in font-sizes, line-heights, margins, padding, which makes it very difficult to create a website which conforms to basic design principles and make a site look its best.</p>\r\n<h2>Components</h2>\r\n<p>The reset sheet resets all pre-defined styles to <a href=\"http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Meyer's CSS Reset Sheet</a> which is a widely used stylesheet to resolve many browser inconsistencies. This has been used as the basis for much of this project but other issues and inconsistencies specific to Business Catalyst have also been addressed.</p>\r\n<h2>Current Fixes</h2>\r\n<p>To Date the following items have been addressed:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Resolved incorrect use of .clear method and applied correct use of .clearfix</li>\r\n<li>Made all button styles consistent to match the default use of the images for the buttons in eCommerce template.</li>\r\n<li>Removed all default padding & margins.</li>\r\n<li>Reset all typography font-sizes, line-heights, colours.</li>\r\n<li>Allowed all inheritable elements to properly inherit from their parent objects.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Known Issues</h2>\r\n<p>There are still some issues being resolved in regards to CSS Specificity and Inheritance and still some functionality of BC that have yet to be tested such as the Forums, eCommerce Poplets, Photogallery and Dynamic Menus.</p>\r\n<p>A complete list of the status of these items will be published during the next update of the Reset Sheet.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>For more information about being an <a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.com.au\" title=\"Abobe Business Catalyst Partner\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Business Catalyst Partner</a>, visit our website.</p>","name":"Adobe Business Catalyst Reset Project","google":"UA-6114966-1"}
